# VSIP Research & Methodology - How We Improve Learning Outcomes

## Research Foundation: India vs. China Education Systems

### Key Findings from Comparative Research

#### India's Current State
- **Scale**: ~248 million students across ~1.47 million schools
- **Infrastructure**: Computer and internet availability rose sharply since 2019-20
- **Dropout Rates**: Declined to 1.9% (primary), 5.2% (upper primary), 14.1% (secondary)
- **Learning Gap**: Learning-Adjusted Years of Schooling (LAYS) ~7.2 (2020)
- **ASER 2023/2024 Findings**:
  - ~25% of rural 14-18 year-olds cannot read Grade-2 text
  - ~43% can do Grade-3/4 division
  - Digital awareness is high but academic use is limited
- **Education Spending**: ~4.1% of GDP (2022)
- **Teacher Time-on-Task**: Historically ~25% teacher absence; inspections and infrastructure correlate with lower absence
- **DIKSHA Platform**: >564 crore learning sessions; need to convert usage into routine learning time

#### China's Approach (Reference Point)
- **LAYS**: ~9.3 (2020) - significantly higher than India
- **Compulsory Education**: 9-year compulsory education system
- **PISA Performance**: Sub-national provinces (B-S-J-Z) topped PISA 2018
- **Vocational Pathways**: ~40% upper-secondary vocational share
- **Education Spending**: ~4.0% of GDP (2023) - similar to India but better efficiency

## Why India Lags on Learning Outcomes

### Core Drivers (What We Need to Address)

1. **Foundational Proficiency Gaps**
   - Reading Grade-2 text proficiency is low
   - Basic arithmetic by Grade-3/4 is insufficient
   - **Our Solution**: Daily FLN Power Hour, ASER-style assessments, TaRL grouping

2. **Lower LAYS (Quality-Adjusted Schooling)**
   - Quantity of schooling doesn't translate to quality learning
   - **Our Solution**: Time-on-task tracking, active instruction minutes monitoring

3. **Time-on-Task and Instructional Minutes**
   - Teacher absence and low active instruction time
   - **Our Solution**: Period logger, inspection adherence tracking, wall dashboard visibility

4. **Weak Vocational Exposure**
   - Very low vocational enrolment in upper secondary (~2-6%)
   - **Our Solution**: (Phase-1 focuses on FLN; vocational exposure in later phases)

5. **Inconsistent Digital Learning Routines**
   - High device access but low routine academic use
   - **Our Solution**: QR Companion for daily DIKSHA practice, streak tracking

## Implementation Philosophy

### Design Principles (Informed by Research)

1. **Start with Foundations**: FLN before advanced topics (evidence: foundational gaps are root cause)
2. **Group by Skill, Not Grade**: TaRL methodology (evidence: J-PAL/Pratham)
3. **Make It Visible**: Dashboards and posters (evidence: transparency improves accountability)
4. **Low Friction**: Minimal data entry (evidence: teacher time constraints)
5. **Routine Over Intensity**: Daily 60-90 min > weekly intensive (evidence: spaced practice)
6. **Parent Engagement**: WhatsApp nudges (evidence: home-school connection improves outcomes)
7. **Digital as Routine**: QR Companion (evidence: DIKSHA has scale, needs routine usage)

## Next Steps for Implementation

Understanding this research foundation helps us:
1. **Prioritize Features**: FLN Power Hour and assessments are core (not nice-to-have)
2. **Design UX**: Low-friction, offline-first (village reality)
3. **Track Metrics**: VEQI components are research-backed (not arbitrary)
4. **Build for Scale**: Evidence shows these interventions work at scale (TaRL, DIKSHA)
